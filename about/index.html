          One of my first projects had a lot of animation and event handling in it. I was always 
          fascinated by it. Always wanted to explore more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I came across these wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman" 
          target="_blank">videos</a> by Daniel Shiffman. That was the spark I needed!
        </p>

          Obviously most of the segments here are direct reproduction or highly inspired from the 
          above mentioned collection. But this is my learning phase, and hope is that I will have 
          have something up pretty interesting on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way the segments are arranged is a bit haphazard. I will keep adding as and when I 
          fancy something to animate. While some of the segments will be quick, some will be a 
          project on it's own and I will keep on modifying them in future.
