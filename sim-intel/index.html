              <p>
                Long ago I had watched a movie <em>Idiocracy</em>. The reason I remembered the 
                movie is because of its premise.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the course of years, generations become dumber and dumber. The base idea being 
                <em>the most intelligent humans to choose not to have children while the less 
                intelligent reproduce indiscriminately</em>. Hmmm... wonder if I can simulate that.
              </p>
              <tabbed-pane>
                <tab-content name="The Rules" selected>
                  <p><em>The Rules (based on my assumptions)</em></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      IQ of the child is based on the parents. I know this is far fetched as in 
                      reality environment plays a strong role. But for this simulation, it's gonna 
                      be the average of both parents, with a slight chance of IQ being a little bit 
                      higher than the intelligent of the two parents and conversely same chance of 
                      being little bit stupider than the stupidest of the two.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Partner selection will be based on age and IQ. Again, in the real world we 
                      have people with spouses old enough to their granddaughter. Also, people marry 
                      just for money or looks. But not in this simulation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Giving birth to an offspring also depends on factors like current job of the 
                      parents, etc. Basically more intelligent parents will give weightage to their 
                      job more than family. <em>This is the golden rule that leads to the basic idea 
                      of Idiocracy.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Education and Job do somewhat depend on the IQ. For example, to enroll for 
                      graduation, you need a certain level of IQ. Similarly for specialization you 
                      need an even higher IQ. The job you get depends on the education level that 
                      you have, so indirectly depend on IQ. This has been detailed out further 
                      in <em>The Flow</em> section.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      To control the population from growing indefinitely (don't want the computer to 
                      crawl due to sheer calculation), a max cap is set for each state after which a 
                      nice <em>1 child policy</em> kicks in. Also, people die. From a certain age 
                      onwards there is a chance of you being fatally ill (this increases with age 
                      and at 100 you die). There is also a recovery percentage based on how many 
                      researchers and specialized personnel are there in the population.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </tab-content>
                <tab-content name="The States">
                  <p><em>What's a State?</em></p>
                  <p>
                    A state is like a region where the population resides. For this simulation, 
                    interstate travel is not possible. So a person born in 1 state lives in that same 
                    state for the rest of his/her life along with his/her generations.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The pink and the blue dot pointed out by the red circle represents a single 
                    female and a single male in this state. The dots pointed out by the green 
                    circle shows a couple. The dots in blue circle shows a family with 2 kids, a 
                    boy and a girl.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the selection of states, the first choice, <em>State of All</em>, has a 
                    population cap of 5000 with their IQ range from 55 to 145. This aptly simulates 
                    the movie. The average IQ keeps dipping over time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second choice is where I separated them out in three groups, the State Names 
                    say it all. For each state the population is capped at 2500. While the IQ range 
                    of them are [45-75], [80-110] and [120-150] respectively.

                In <a target="_blank" href="../electronic-life/">Electronic Life</a> I had used 
                <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/" target="_blank">Chart.js</a> to render the 
                data visualization. Here I wrote custom code to render them.

                <tab-content name="Age" selected>
                  This gives us the total population and also the Age wise distribution of the 
                  population. <br>
                  <p class="center"><img src="./img/age_01.jpg" alt="The Total"><br></p>
                  Here out of 387 people in the said region, 189 are males and rest are females. <br>
                  <p class="center"><img src="./img/age_02.jpg" alt="Age Wise"><br></p>
                  This is a Multi Bar Graph showing the distribution of population across different 
                  age groups. For each age group, we have a male, a female and an all bar (which is 
                  nothing but a sum of males and females in that age group). The numbers below 
                  account for the number of persons (390 being total population) and each square 
                  being a tenth of it. This gives us that the total number of kids is around 80.
                </tab-content>
                <tab-content name="IQ">
                  Here we detail out the IQ distribution. <br>

                  What this tells us is that the stupidest person in this population has an IQ of 
                  76 while the most intelligent one has an IQ of 113. The average IQ is 92.
                  <p class="center"><img src="./img/iq_02.jpg" alt="IQ Wise"><br></p>
                  A Bar Graph showing the IQ distribution in the population. According 
                  to this data, around 890 fall in the average intelligence range with IQ between 
                  85 and 115. There are no above average or geniuses in this population.
                </tab-content>
                <tab-content name="Education">
                  Now for the Education distribution. <br>
                  <p class="center"><img src="./img/edu_01.jpg" alt="Education percentage"><br></p>
                  This bar shows that out of a population of 378, 257 are educated. The rest are 
                  yet to complete their education. <br>
                  <p class="center"><img src="./img/edu_02.jpg" alt="Round and round"><br></p>
                  The Pie Chart shows the distribution of population on different levels of 
                  education. Due to the high requirements for Post Specialization, only few select 
                  can opt for it. The outer circle shows the distribution of male and female for 
                  the education level in the inner circle. Again, blue for male and pink for female.
                </tab-content>
                <tab-content name="Job">
                  Lastly, for Job distribution. <br>
                  <p class="center"><img src="./img/job_01.jpg" alt="Job percentage"><br></p>
                  This bar shows that out of a population of 166, 66 are in jobs. The rest are 
                  yet to complete their education or already retired. <br>
                  <p class="center"><img src="./img/job_02.jpg" alt="Round and round"><br></p>
                  The Pie Chart shows the distribution of population in different job types. Here 
                  as we can see, Research field is the least employed, again due to the high 
                  requirements to join the same. The outer circle shows the distribution of male 
                  and female for the job in the inner circle. Again, blue for male and pink for 
                  female.
