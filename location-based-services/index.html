                <em>Location Based Service</em> are software services which use geographic data to provide 
                information/services to users. In today's connected world where almost everyone has a smart 
                phone, LBS is integrated in multiple applications. Few uses: <ul>
                  <li>Find nearest business or service (ATM, restaurant, Service Station)</li>
                  <li>Recommending Events around you</li>
                  <li>Alert Notification (Traffic Jam, Extreme Weather)</li>
                  <li>Avail Delivery Service (Food Delivery)</li>
                  <li>Mobile Advertising based on location</li>

              <div class="sub-header"><p>The Simulation</p></div>
              <p>We will take up two of the most common use cases in this simulation.</p>
              <p>
                Imagine that you are a tourist in one of the most happening city, by the beach, let's call it 
                <em>Beach City</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are here to party. To help you with that you have two awesome apps installed in your 
                <em>M-Phone</em> on the right. These apps are minimalist in nature ... ie. they accomplish 
                the main functionality only.
              </p>
              <tabbed-pane>
                <tab-content name="Map" selected>
                  <p>
                    On the left is the map of the whole of <em>Beach City</em>. You will start right at the 
                    center of it. Click anywhere on the map to change your location.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Depending on which App is active, the map will be populated with all the POIs on it. So 
                    for <em>NearBar</em>, the Breweries and Pubs will shine in orange and violet respectively. 
                    For <em>NearCar</em>, live location of all the cabs (hired or available) will be shown. 
                    The violet ones will be the available cabs and hired cabs will be colored in orange.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A visual representation of the selected DB will also be rendered here for you to check 
                    how the query works out. The query area will be marked for clarity.
                  </p>
                </tab-content>
                <tab-content name="NearBar">
                  <p>
                    What's a party unless you are few pints down? As a tourist in a new place you want some 
                    way to locate where are the best breweries and pubs in the city.
                  </p>
                  <p>Think Yelp.</p>
                  <p>
                    It recognizes where you are and displays the popular places nearby and highlighted reviews
                    of those places. You can share your own reviews, rate businesses, reserve a table (if 
                    possible) in your selected place.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here we are just targeting the <em>find places nearby</em> part of the functionality. 
                  </p>
                </tab-content>
                <tab-content name="NearCar">
                  <p>
                    You have done your share of pub-hopping for the day (or night). Time to recharge for the 
                    next day. But you are also a responsible citizen and you know <em>Drink n Drive</em> is 
                    a no-no.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Uber or Ola is the go to app to book a cab. Based on your location they give you the 
                    nearest cabs available, you can select car type, the charge for the ride will be displayed 
                    and you also get real time update on your app on where your cab is.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Again, we are just targeting the <em>find me a nearby cab</em> part of the functionality. 
                    (You can't actually book a cab). The difference with the earlier app is that here there the 
                    POIs were static and here they are dynamic.
                  </p>
                </tab-content>
              </tabbed-pane>
              <div class="sub-header"><p>Limitations of Traditional Database</p></div>
              <p>To mark a location, we use Latitude and Longitude (here we use x and y coordinates).</p>
              <p>
                Let's say we have a traditional database where we have stored all our <em>Points of 
                Interest</em> with their locations. Now if we have the following query <em>Find all Points of 
                Interest from a specified location within a specified range</em> (all breweries within 5 
                km). A typical query would look something like:
              </p>
              <code-formatter language="sql">
                <span slot="code">
                  select * 
                  from POI_TABLE as poi 
                  where distance_between(
                    poi.LOC, specifiedLocation
                  ) &lt; specifiedRange
                </span>
              </code-formatter>
              <p>
                Essentially, this is a full table scan and needless to say that with more POIs added by 
                the day, it's not a scalable query.
              </p>
              <div class="sub-header"><p>Spatial Database</p></div>
              <p>
                <em>Location Based Service</em> operate on a specialized database optimized for storing and 
                querying data representing objects in a geometric space. These databases are called 
                <em>Spatial Database</em> and the queries <em>Spatial Queries</em>. In this segment we are 
                focusing on the following properties: <ul>
                  <li>Location assignment should be uniform</li>
                  <li>The Database should be scalable and granular</li>
                  <li>Should allow proximity query</li>
                </ul>

                  <p>
                    Quadtree is a tree data structure used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively 
                    subdividing it into four quadrants or regions. We will be using <em>Region Quad Tree</em> 
                    and create a <em>Spatial Index</em> for the data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With this the search will be restricted to a much smaller scope and hence improving the 
                    performance manifold.

                        This is analogous to Binary Seach. The root node is the whole space. Recursively 
                        find in the subquadrants till a leaf node is reached.

                        Unlike traditional databases, the range query in Quadtree doesn't do a full table 
                        scan and only considers the quads that intersect with the query space. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Moreover, because of the heirarchical nature of the structure, the leaf node can be 
                        reached in logarithmic time complexity. In the below tree, the region which contains 
                        the point can be reached in 5 jumps.

                        The biggest hurdle is that the tree creation is totally dependent on data distribution. 
                        As the quads are created based on data density, if there are updates/deletes, it 
                        defeats the purpose of this data structure as it needs to be reshaped which will be an 
                        expensive operation. So the use cases are restricted to data which are more or less 
                        static and don't change much often.

                        Since data is not evenly distributed (cities will have far more POIs than villages), 
                        some quads might go very deep while some quads might stay empty. This results in an 
                        unbalanced tree. Optimizations are available in form of Compressed Quadtrees where 
                        only subtrees with POIs are kept and empty nodes are pruned.

                    The basic idea of any space-filling curve is to contain an entire 2-dimensional square. 
                    Hilbert Curve is of the same family.

                        While we don't have good algorithms to search over a 2-D space, we do have excellent 
                        algorithms to perform the same over 1-D line. So if a 2-D space can be represented 
                        over a 1-D line, we have the solution to the problem. This is the motivation for 
                        space-filling curve.

                        The way the Hilbert Curve goes through the square is again analogous to breaking the 
                        original square into four quadrants, and then breaking each of those quadrants down 
                        into further quadrants.

                        Now we assign POIs to Hilbert Nodes based on their location in the square. 
                        <em>What's a Hilbert Node?</em> All the points where the curve turns, is a Hilbert 
                        Node. Theoretically Hilbert Curve can go to infinite levels so that every point on 
                        the curve can be covered, practically it's makes sense to represent a small region by 
                        a node.

                        Every POI is marked by a co-ordinate (lat -long in the real world, in our case, x,y). I 
                        came across an iterative algorithm to draw a Hilbert curve of any given level. The 
                        main method <em>hilbertIndex2xy(n)</em>, gives back normalized (x,y) co-ordinate of
                        n<sup>th</sup> node. The algorithm is much better explained <a target="_blank" href=
                        "http://blog.marcinchwedczuk.pl/iterative-algorithm-for-drawing-hilbert-curve">here</a>.
                        So while the nodes and co-ordinates are calculated to generate the curve, the same can 
                        be put into arrays for quick reference later.

                        Hilbert curve is drawn in a square. Even the algorithm mentioned above takes in 
                        units of 1. So for a 4 &times; 4 grid, node 0 starts at (0,0) and node 15 ends at 
                        (3,3). <em>hilbertIndex2xy(2)</em> = (1,1) and <em>hilbertIndex2xy(8)</em> = (2,2).

                        Given a co-ordinate, scale it down to map to the unit grid. Then use the cache to 
                        identify which Hilbert node, the co-ordinate corresponds to. Let's make the node as h. 
                        The range to search is also scaled down for the unit grid. Let's assume the range has 
                        been scaled down to scRange. Then all the POIs from nodes (h - scRange) to (h + 
                        scRange) are selected for range validation.

                        Similar to the advantage that Quadtree has. Even here we avoid full table scans and 
                        access to data over the range can be made even more performant by having a segment 
                        tree or an interval tree over the Hilbert Codes.

                        The major (at least that's what I feel) limitation is the range calculation accuracy 
                        for the nodes. Let's take the same curve from before.

                        Let's say that I have a query to search for POIs around (1,1) for a range of 1. Now 
                        we know (1,1) corresponds to Hilbert node 2. So the range is from node 2 &plusmn;1. 
                        This includes (1,0), (1,1) and (0,1).
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        If the offset is doubled to the range to search, ei, from node 2 &plusmn;2, the above 
                        co-ordinates would be covered. But we still haven't covered (1,2), (2,3), (2,1) and 
                        (2,0). To cover all of them, a range of 1 has to have an offset of &plusmn;12 in this 
                        case. But that would also include nodes 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 and 12 which are clearly out 
                        of range. This gives us a lot to think about when fine tuning range to offset 
                        calculation.

                        The above problem can be minimized by having a higher order of Hilbert Curve. The more 
                        dense the curve is, the range to offset approximation gets better.

                      <p>
                        But there are still edge cases where while the co-ordinates are nearby in reality, 
                        but Hilbert node wise they are <em>really faaaaaaar away</em>. This is even more 
                        evident in the nodes near the intersection where the quadrants meet. Take a look 
                        into the below Hilbert Curve of Oder 3. Hilbert Nodes 10 and 53 are only 1 unit 
                        distance apart.

                        mapped to a subregion quite granular in nature. Every region is denoted by a letter 
                        added to its parent. So we start with 32 regions from 0-9, a-z (minus a,i,l,o), and for 
                        every region, we have 32 subregions (again with alphanumeric denotions), and for every 
                        one of those subregions, we have 32 sub-subregions ... and so on.

                            The last letter of the hash of a region gives its positioning with respect to it's 
                            parent region. eg. the region <em>cadab</em> is the top right quadrant of its 
                            parent <em>cada</em>.
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For any region, its neighbor will be either a sibling quadrant or a sub-quadrant of 
                        it's parent's sibling. Below I have how to get the north and north west neighbor. 
                        Same idea for the rest.

                        Similar to the advantage that Quadtree and Hilbert Curve has. Even here we avoid full 
                        table scans. The query is extremely performant as we are hashing out the regions. On a 
                        large scale, the database can easily be distributed based on region hash.

                      <p>
                        Since we are assigning hash to a region and then associating each POI to that hash 
                        based on their location, this database can also take in dynamic POIs.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Moreover hash index queries are inherently faster and updates to a POI (delete from 
                        old region and adding to an new region) will be a breeze.
                      </p>
                      <p><span class="hilight">Over Hilbert Curve</span></p>
                      <p>
                        The range approximation and edge case limitations are non-existent here because of 
                        the neighbor find intermediate step. Unlike <em>Hilbert Curve</em>, all the regions 
                        around the query location are taken into account.
