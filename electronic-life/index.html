              <p>
                Long back I came across a wonderful resource to learn <a 
                href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">javaScript</a>. I don't 
                want to discuss that here as I won't be doing justice to it. Needless to say I 
                learned a lot from it. Especially from the projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                One such project in it was, well, Electronic Life. Idea is to build a virtual 
                ecosystem populated with electronic creatures. I decided to recreate it.
              </p>
              <div id="chart-container">
                <strong>Population Chart</strong>
                <canvas id="statsChart" width="250" height="100"></canvas>
              </div>
              <p>
                The <em>Population Chart</em> gives out the count of creatures alive on a given day 
                for last 100 days.
              </p>
              <p>
                The original project had alphabets for depicting living and non-living. Every 
                <em>turn</em> the creatures get a chance to take some action. So plants grow and 
                critters move around trying to eat up plants. Of course, I couldn't have 
                the sketchpad have alphabets, I can do much better now. Thus we have the return 
                of the <a target="_blank" href="../creatures/">Creatures</a>. Instead of  turns, I 
                kept the unit as <em>day</em>. So every day, if the creature is not busy doing 
                something, it gets to select among one of it's actions and act upon it.
              </p>
              <p><em>The Environments:</em></p>
              <tabbed-pane>
                <tab-content name="Moving World" selected>
                  The first world is pretty simple. It is populated with creatures which just 
                  indefinitely move around.<br><br>
                  In the original project there was <em>Bouncing Critter (o)</em> which moved around 
                  randomly bouncing off walls. Here that role is played by the <em>Fly</em>. <br><br>
                  The second critter was a <em>Wall Follower (~)</em> which moves along the walls. 
                  Here the <em>Turtle</em> is inducted to depict the same.<br><br>
                  From the <em>flat</em> Population chart it should be clear that this is quite a 
                  boring world.
                </tab-content>
                <tab-content name="Living World">
                  Here things start to get interesting. Creatures can also reproduce (asexually), 
                  eat and die.<br><br>
                  The original project had <em>Plants (*)</em>, <em>Plant Eaters (O)</em> and 
                  <em>Predators (@)</em>. <br><br>
                  It had introduced the concept of energy which is required for movement (if not 
                  plant), survival, and reproduction. Plants can accumulate energy on their own over 
                  a period of time. Plant-Eaters on the other hand eat plants for energy, which then 
                  they use up for moving and reproduction. And on the top of the food chain we have 
                  the Predators feeding on the plant eaters.<br><br>
                  The organisms can die too, if they get eaten or run out of energy. <br><br>
                  For my version the plant is replaced by <em>Lily</em>, Plant Eater by 
                  <em>Worm</em> and Predator by <em>Fish</em>. <br><br>
                  Sustaining this world is tough! Very soon you might see the lines flat out on 
                  the Chart, a desolate world. Sometimes the world might just be left with plants.
                </tab-content>
                <tab-content name="Symbiotic World">
                  This is my own problem statement. Actually the <em>Living World</em> had lots of 
                  hunting and killing which my 6 year old QA specialist was not very happy about.<br><br>
                  So to counter that I came up with this beautiful world full of flowers where 
                  nobody kills anybody for survival and everybody lives happy ever after. <br><br>
                  For the creatures, I got a little lazy this time and instead of coming up with 
                  something new (I had done that with <em>Fish</em> already), I reused existing 
                  creatures <em>Lily</em> and <em>Fly</em> from the previous world giving them 
                  additional/alternate behaviours to live in a symbiotic manner. <br><br>
                  Pollinators and Pollinables (not sure if that's a word) help each other. The 
                  former collects nectar from the later for survival and the later exchanges pollen 
                  through the former for reproduction.<br><br>
                  A new type of non-living actor was added here. <em>Hive</em>. That's where the 
                  pollinators live and thrive. The collected nectar is stored here and it 
                  transforms the same to energy that can be shared among the residents. The hive 
                  cells will get filled up with nectar as and when it is collected (nice golden 
                  fluid).

                <tab-content name="Fly" selected>
                  As the name suggests, it flies around. Can't land on water. So it flies from 
                  land tile to land tile.<br><br>
                  Needs rest between every flight.

                  This creature keeps itself restricted to shallow water. So it moves around

                <tab-content name="Lily">
                  This is the only life-form in this world that doesn't move around. Grows on the

                  it to drop a seed. <br><br>
                  Can get eaten up and die. <br><br>
                  As the Lily doesn't move around, to make it interesting to look at, they have 
                  different colors and different number of petals.

                      <em>The Smart One:</em> In the original project, multiple solutions were

                  Special reproduction by pollination. <br><br>
                  To simulate that, a Lily can only reproduce if it has got a pollen from another 
                  Lily. So when a pollinator lands on a Lily, if it is ready for reproduction (the 
                  required energy and empty space condition remains), checks if the pollinator has 
                  a pollen to offer. If yes, reproduces, if no then the lily attaches its own 
                  pollen to the pollinator to enable reproduction for some other Lily. <br><br>
                  Another change here is that for the offspring, the petal color is a blend of 
                  itself and parents. Gives some variety to the world.

                  deposit them in the Hive. Every trip they visit multiple Lily's and also carry 
                  pollen from them to spread around. <br><br>
                  Once it deposits the collected nectar in the Hive, the Hive recharges them with 
                  energy so that they can make the next trip.

                  The flies can't reproduce. Only the <em>Queen</em> can give birth to more flies. 
                  Visually it's just an oversized Fly. But behaviour wise it's only job is to 
                  give birth to more flies for the Hive. <br><br>
                  The Queen doesn't go around to collect nectar/energy. That is shared to her by 
                  the other flies from their collection. Once it has enough energy, it gives 
                  birth to a young fly who goes straight to work collecting more nectar. <br><br>
                  Once the Hive is fully populated, the Queen's primary job is done and 
                  occasionally she flies around the archipelago.

              <p><em>The Controls:</em></p>
              <p>
                While the moving world is a basic (boring) one, the living world is quite dynamic 
                in nature. Use the controls to simulate a living world of your liking.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the symbiotic world, you can select how many flies you want it to have. 
                Sparsely populated or overpopulated.
              </p>
              <p>Make sure to <em>Launch</em> the world after your selections are done.</p>
